	</ui>
	
	
	
	<p>Now let's get throw some dungeon(PVE) guides:</p>
	<ui>
		
		<li>First of all, for any game style, player must have <i><b>fixed</b></i> stats</li>
		<li>Right legendary(the legendary is situational and might changed with the rotation and dungeon, or even the group management)</li>
		<li>As a healer, most important thing is, to stay calm no matter what is going on, even tho the group is almost wiped, yet healer needs to stay calm and control the situation(most of the times healer can save a wipe).</li>
		<li>I used to coach how to play WOW, and I always told my students to follow <a href="https://www.wowhead.com"><b>Wowhead's</b></a> guides about their class and dungeons as this websites explains everything about their calss and what to do in different situations in each dungeon.</li>

	<p>Let's talk about some huge tips for Shaman Restoration:</p>
	<ui>
		<li>First I would say always use Riptide per CD and use them on the target with the lowest hp (because of shaman's mastery, their heal is more efective based on mastery% and the target's missing health%).</li>
		<li>First I would say always use Static totem(cc) per CD that helps tank to manage their CDs and help them to cite the ads. </li>
		<li><b>ALWAYS</b> use healing surge or healing wave with <b>TIDAL WAVE</b> stack, and do not let <u>TIDAL WAVE to over stack</u>(max stacks=2)</li>
		<li>Use healing wave in normal situation when GP is not taking much damage</li>
		<li>USE your last brain cell to dodge every thing</li>
